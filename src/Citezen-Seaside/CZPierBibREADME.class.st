--TO DO--
BibFile
- add view controls

BibList
- sort order

BibQuery
- stores a fixed query with query options
- cache query result
- timestamp invalidated when source file modified

--ABOUT--
These classes (all starting with CZPier -- we elide the prefix here for readability) are intended to replace the scgbib.cgi script with a pure Pier/Seaside solution.
Requirements are here: http://scg.unibe.ch/wiki/scgjoblist/scgpier/pierbib

The key class is BibFile, which points to a local bib file (e.g., scg.bib). It keeps track of the timestamp and reloads the file whenever it changes. It splits the file into a BibList of BibEntry objects. Each BibEntry holds the text of a bibtext entry, and lazily parses it only if needed (i.e., for rendering). BibFileView generates the interface for ad hoc queries.

BibFile and BibQuery are PRStructures, so they can reside at a fixed URL. BibQuery points to a BibFile and encapsulates a fixed query. It caches its result and updates it only if the BibFile timestamp changes.

BibQuerySpec is used to encapsulate all the parameters to a query and the display options.
